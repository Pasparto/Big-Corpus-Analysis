## Description
Big Corpus Notebook
This file contains a number of functions used to analyze large corpora of text. These functions include: 

1. tokenize(): This function takes a string of text and returns a list of tokens. 

2. stem(): This function takes a list of tokens and returns a list of stemmed words. 

3. remove_stop_words(): This function takes a list of tokens and returns a list of words with stop words removed. 

4. pos_tag(): This function takes a list of tokens and returns a list of part-of-speech tagged words. 

5. plot_word_frequency(): This function takes a list of words and plots the frequency of each word in the corpus.

###### TF
TF (or Term Frequency) is a metric used in natural language processing to measure the importance of a word in a document. It is calculated as the number of times a word appears in a document divided by the total number of words in the document. TF is used in many applications, such as document classification, text summarization, and information retrieval.

###### TF-IDF
TF-IDF (or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a metric used in natural language processing to measure the importance of a word in a document relative to a corpus of documents. It is calculated by multiplying the term frequency (TF) of a word by the inverse document frequency (IDF) of the same word. The TF-IDF metric is used in many applications, such as document classification, text summarization, and information retrieval.

###### cos-similarity
Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors, usually used for measuring similarity between two documents. It is calculated by taking the dot product of two vectors and dividing it by the product of their lengths. The result is a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being completely dissimilar and 1 being perfectly similar. Cosine similarity is used in many applications, such as document classification, text summarization, and information retrieval.
The cosine similarity equation is:

similarity = cos(θ) = A · B / ||A|| ||B||

where A and B are two vectors, θ is the angle between them, and ||A|| and ||B|| are the lengths of the vectors.

###### K-means
K-means is a clustering algorithm (an unsupervised algorithm) used in machine learning to partition data into clusters. It works by assigning each data point to a cluster based on its distance to the cluster's centroid (center point). It works by randomly assigning each data point to a cluster and then iteratively computing the centroid (center point) of each cluster. The algorithm then assigns each data point to the cluster with the closest centroid. This process is repeated until the clusters converge and the centroids remain stable. K-means is used in many applications, such as image segmentation, object recognition, and market segmentation.

###### Normalize Vector
Normalizing a vector is the process of transforming it so that its length (or magnitude) is 1. This is done by dividing each element of the vector by its length. Normalizing a vector is often used in machine learning to make sure all the input features are on the same scale, which helps the model learn more effectively.
